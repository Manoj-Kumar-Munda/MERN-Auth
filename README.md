##Overview
This repo provides a comprehensive guide on implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) authorization in a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application. The implementation includes the use of both access and refresh tokens, with a focus on handling token expiration in the frontend using Axios response interceptors. The mechanism involves seamlessly generating new tokens on access token expiration using the refresh token.
